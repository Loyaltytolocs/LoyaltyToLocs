/*
To make life easier, we have created a new class which we have called
EasyScanner.

To make life really easy we have written the class so that we don’t have to create
new Scanner objects in order to use it

 (that is taken care of in the class itself)—
and we have written it so that you can simply use the name of the class itself when
you call a method The following program demonstrates how to use these methods.
