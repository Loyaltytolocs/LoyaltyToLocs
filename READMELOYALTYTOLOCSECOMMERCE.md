I decided to go with this project because I currently make hair products and I do locs for a living, so I decided to build an ecommerce and appointment booking website for my project. Building this full stack site will allow me to provide purchasing of products from clients that have moved or live far away as well as a convenient way for clients to visualize my availability and book me accordingly. I have encountered a few problems from servlet issues to issues with aligning images and forms. Creating this project taught me a lot and I incorporated different ways I’ve used html, CSS and Javascript.
I will be using Spring Boot, Core Java, Java Script, My SQL, ORM, Hibernate, HTML, CSS,  React, CRUD to assist in the making of this website.
